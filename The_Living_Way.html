<h1>The Scroll of The Living Way</h1>
<h2>\large \textit{The 81 Sayings of Yeshua the Living One</h2>
<h2>The Light Before the World</h2>
<h3 id="s1-the-way-that-is-not-seen">1. The Way That Is Not Seen</h3>
<p>The Word caught in ink is a husk; <br>the Word lived is a devouring fire. <br>The Kingdom is spread upon the earth, <br>yet few behold it.</p>
<p>Those who hunt with the eyes <br>find only shadows. <br>Those who rest in the still heart <br>find the Source <br>from which all seeing springs.</p>
<h3 id="s2-the-two-become-one">2. The Two Become One</h3>
<p>The world is born of the cut in two— <br>male and female, light and shadow, life and death. <br>Yet these divisions are garments only.</p>
<p>Truly I say to you: <br>when the two are made one, <br>the lion within you lies down as a child, <br>and the child awakens <br>as the One who is not born.</p>
<p>Then the bridal chamber opens in your depths.</p>
<h3 id="s3-the-poverty-of-the-unknowing">3. The Poverty of the Unknowing</h3>
<p>People cling to the loud voices of the world. <br>They trust laws more than their own heart, <br>beliefs more than living knowing. <br>Thus they sit in a treasury, <br>yet starve.</p>
<p>One who knows the self <br>no longer hoards teachings in a scroll. <br>Their very being becomes the scroll.</p>
<h3 id="s4-the-father-of-light">4. The Father of Light</h3>
<p>There is a Light that gives birth to itself— <br>unborn, unbroken, unbound. <br>From this Light you came; <br>to this Light you return when you awaken.</p>
<p>The Father bears no wrath. <br>The Source casts no shadow. <br>Only the garments of the soul <br>weave darkness.</p>
<h3 id="s5-the-powers-question-the-soul">5. The Powers Question the Soul</h3>
<p>Desire whispers, "You are mine." <br>Ignorance declares, "You do not know yourself." <br>Anger cries, "Strike, and be struck." <br>The body murmurs, "I am all there is."</p>
<p>But the awakened soul smiles and replies: <br>"You never touched me. <br>You grasped only my clothing."</p>
<h3 id="s6-the-hollow-reed">6. The Hollow Reed</h3>
<p>The false self is a wall of stone— <br>it resists the wind and crumbles. <br>The soul is a hollow reed— <br>it lets the Spirit breathe through it.</p>
<p>When you are empty, <br>even the storm becomes a song.</p>
<h3 id="s7-the-unforced-kingdom">7. The Unforced Kingdom</h3>
<p>The Kingdom comes by neither effort nor delay. <br>When you stop grasping at life, <br>life reveals itself as eternal.</p>
<p>When you cease seeking the Kingdom, <br>you discover you never left it.</p>
<p>What you call "sin" is forgetting. <br>What you call "salvation" is remembering.</p>
<h3 id="s8-the-servant-at-the-feast">8. The Servant at the Feast</h3>
<p>Be as the servant who seeks the lowest place at the feast. <br>He does not contend, <br>yet the Master calls him forward.</p>
<p>So too the one who knows the Father <br>takes the lowest seat <br>and finds there the highest.</p>
<p>Humility is not making the self small; <br>it is seeing that the self is a shadow.</p>
<h3 id="s9-the-teacher-who-does-not-teach">9. The Teacher Who Does Not Teach</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Kingdom Within</h2>
<h3 id="s10-the-single-eye">10. The Single Eye</h3>
<p>If the eye of the body is divided, <br>it sees only confusion. <br>If the eye of the heart is single, <br>it fills the whole body with light.</p>
<p>The Nous stands between soul and spirit— <br>a lamp lit from both sides. <br>Guard this lamp, <br>and the night cannot touch you.</p>
<h3 id="s11-the-inner-and-the-outer">11. The Inner and the Outer</h3>
<p>The cup is precious for its emptiness. <br>So too the self is precious <br>when it is emptied of self.</p>
<p>Inside and outside are mirrors. <br>When they reflect without distortion, <br>the All is revealed.</p>
<h3 id="s12-the-lion-and-the-child">12. The Lion and the Child</h3>
<p>The world teaches you to be a lion— <br>to conquer, to claim, to devour. <br>But I tell you: unless the lion becomes a child, <br>you will not know the Living Source.</p>
<p>The child is open, unguarded, whole. <br>There is no image of self to defend. <br>Therefore the child steps into the Kingdom easily.</p>
<h3 id="s13-the-unbinding">13. The Unbinding</h3>
<p>What binds you is not outside you. <br>What frees you is not outside you. <br>Prison and key <br>are fashioned from the same ignorance.</p>
<p>Awaken, and you will laugh— <br>for there were never any gates.</p>
<h3 id="s14-the-return-to-the-unborn">14. The Return to the Unborn</h3>
<p>Before you were a form, you were the Breath. <br>Before you were breath, you were the Light. <br>Before you were the Light, <br>you were hidden in the Source.</p>
<p>To return is not to go backwards; <br>it is to remember the place <br>that has never moved.</p>
<h3 id="s15-the-silence-that-speaks">15. The Silence That Speaks</h3>
<p>Words are nets thrown into the sea. <br>They catch small fish, <br>but the Great Fish slips through.</p>
<p>Do not hunger for many words from me. <br>Hunger for the Silence <br>in which the Word is born. <br>There you and I are one life, <br>one breath, <br>one Being.</p>
<h3 id="s16-the-great-stillness">16. The Great Stillness</h3>
<p>Empty yourself of what you think you are. <br>Let the waters of the heart grow still. <br>When the mud settles by itself, <br>the bottom is revealed.</p>
<p>So too, when the soul becomes quiet, <br>the Light of the Living Source <br>shines through without effort.</p>
<h3 id="s17-the-hidden-guide">17. The Hidden Guide</h3>
<p>The greatest guide is the one who disappears. <br>The seeker awakens and cries: <br>"Look— <br>I have found the Way myself."</p>
<p>Thus I leave no trace, <br>and yet my footprints are everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="s18-when-the-way-is-forgotten">18. When the Way Is Forgotten</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Garment of Silence</h2>
<h3 id="s19-beyond-the-teachings">19. Beyond the Teachings</h3>
<p>Leave the holiness that needs witnesses; <br>return to the wholeness <br>that needs none. <br>Leave the righteousness that lives in the scroll; <br>return to the sight <br>that burns in the heart. <br>Leave the law that threatens from outside; <br>return to the Source <br>that speaks within you as Light.</p>
<p>What you call "good" and "evil" <br>are shadows thrown by a divided mind. <br>When the eye becomes single, <br>the heart needs no commandments.</p>
<h3 id="s20-not-of-this-world">20. Not of This World</h3>
<p>The world shouts; the Way whispers. <br>The world demands belief; the Way asks you to see. <br>The world praises power; the Way dissolves it.</p>
<p>Many chase desires. <br>Few seek liberation. <br>Yet the Kingdom belongs to those <br>who loosen their grip on everything.</p>
<h3 id="s21-the-face-of-the-invisible">21. The Face of the Invisible</h3>
<p>The Way is a child-like mystery— <br>seen only by those who forget themselves.</p>
<p>It has no beginning and no end. <br>It moves without moving. <br>Its face cannot be drawn, <br>yet it shines through your own face <br>when you remember who you are.</p>
<h3 id="s22-the-one-who-is-bent">22. The One Who Is Bent</h3>
<p>If you wish to be whole, let yourself be broken. <br>If you wish to be full, empty yourself. <br>If you wish to be reborn, die to your false image.</p>
<p>I do not raise the proud; <br>I raise only the one <br>who has laid the self down.</p>
<h3 id="s23-the-wind-speaks-briefly">23. The Wind Speaks Briefly</h3>
<p>Speak only what is true, and your words will be few. <br>The wind does not shout; <br>yet entire forests bow before it.</p>
<p>When you speak from the Living Source, <br>your words carry no force— <br>yet they move mountains.</p>
<h3 id="s24-the-tower-that-topples">24. The Tower That Topples</h3>
<p>One who raises the self has already fallen. <br>One who displays virtue has already lost it. <br>One who demands honor has already betrayed the soul.</p>
<p>Stand in your true nature— <br>and honor flows from you without asking.</p>
<h3 id="s25-the-womb-of-silence">25. The Womb of Silence</h3>
<p>There is a womb older than creation. <br>It is the Silence that births the All. <br>It is formless, unbounded. <br>It moves through you as breath, <br>yet it is not the breath.</p>
<p>Those who know Her <br>do not cling to life nor fear death.</p>
<h3 id="s26-the-heavy-root">26. The Heavy Root</h3>
<p>The root of the tree is unseen, <br>yet it holds the whole tree upright. <br>So too the silent depth of your being <br>supports your every step.</p>
<p>Those who forget their root <br>are blown about by every wind— <br>desire, fear, anger, ignorance. <br>Remember your depth, and nothing can uproot you.</p>
<h3 id="s27-the-footprints-of-the-master">27. The Footprints of the Master</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Power of the Gentle</h2>
<h3 id="s28-the-fertile-soil">28. The Fertile Soil</h3>
<p>Know the strength of the sower, <br>yet keep to the softness of the soil— <br>the fertile field that receives the seed.</p>
<p>Know knowledge, yet return to innocence. <br>Thus you become the place <br>where the two become one.</p>
<h3 id="s29-the-futility-of-control">29. The Futility of Control</h3>
<p>Those who attempt to seize the Kingdom <br>shatter it in their own hands. <br>The Kingdom is a living seed, <br>not an empire of stone.</p>
<p>Force bruises the soil. <br>Grasping crushes the grain. <br>But the one who serves the hidden life in all things <br>finds the harvest rising of itself.</p>
<h3 id="s30-the-way-of-non-violence">30. The Way of Non-Violence</h3>
<p>Those who walk in the Way do not harm. <br>They do not conquer. <br>They do not take up the sword.</p>
<p>For every blow you strike strikes you in return. <br>Every wound you inflict <br>becomes your own garment of suffering.</p>
<p>Power gained through violence rots the soul; <br>power gained through awakening cannot be taken away.</p>
<h3 id="s31-the-weapon-of-the-heart">31. The Weapon of the Heart</h3>
<p>Weapons are tools of fear; <br>the heart of the awakened has no use for them. <br>Victory through harm is mourning in disguise.</p>
<p>The wise triumph by dissolving conflict, <br>not by defeating an opponent— <br>seeing no opponent at all.</p>
<h3 id="s32-the-way-the-truth">32. The Way, the Truth</h3>
<p>People ask, "Show us the path." <br>I tell them: \textbf{I am the Way.} <br>People ask, "Show us the doctrine." <br>I tell them: \textbf{I am the Truth.} <br>People ask, "Show us immortality." <br>I tell them: \textbf{I am the Living One.}</p>
<p>The Way is not a map; it is the Single One walking. <br>No one comes to the Father of Light <br>except by becoming what I am.</p>
<h3 id="s33-profit-and-loss">33. Profit and Loss</h3>
<p>You may read the hearts of others <br>and still be a stranger to your own. <br>You may subdue cities <br>and still be ruled by fear within.</p>
<p>To turn the gaze inward is illumination. <br>To befriend your own depth is freedom.</p>
<p>For what profit is there in gaining the ten thousand things <br>if you lose the One who beholds them?</p>
<h3 id="s34-the-great-river">34. The Great River</h3>
<p>The River of the Father and the Mother <br>flows through all worlds, <br>pouring itself into every vessel, <br>claiming nothing as its own.</p>
<p>One who walks in this River <br>acts without self-importance, <br>gives without calculation, <br>rests without pride. <br>Thus they become transparent, <br>and the Living Source is seen through them.</p>
<h3 id="s35-the-face-of-peace">35. The Face of Peace</h3>
<p>Hold fast to the image of the Living One <br>and all beings come to rest in your presence.</p>
<p>Peace is not the absence of conflict; <br>it is the recognition that conflict was a dream. <br>The awakened do not persuade—they radiate.</p>
<h3 id="s36-the-paradox-of-power">36. The Paradox of Power</h3>
<p>To let something expand, first allow it to contract. <br>To let something grow strong, first allow it to weaken. <br>A seed must vanish into dark soil, <br>a breath must empty before it fills.</p>
<p>Thus I guide by reversal, <br>teaching the soul through its own emptiness.</p>
<p>\ornament</p>
<p>% =========================================================<br>% INSERTED SAYING: THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT<br>% (Inner, non-violent discernment that cuts illusion from truth.)</p>
<h3 id="s37-the-sword-of-the-spirit">37. The Sword of the Spirit</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Union of Opposites</h2>
<h3 id="s38-the-ease-of-the-way">38. The Ease of the Way</h3>
<p>The Way acts without effort. <br>When the heart aligns with it, desire loosens its grip.</p>
<p>But when desire rises, the soul becomes troubled. <br>Use the Light to calm the waters, <br>and they become clear again.</p>
<h3 id="s39-true-virtue">39. True Virtue</h3>
<p>High virtue moves like breath--- <br>it does not watch itself being virtuous. <br>Lesser virtue stares into its own reflection, <br>checking whether it appears upright.</p>
<p>When the Kingdom is remembered, <br>goodness blossoms of itself. <br>When it is forgotten, <br>people invent commandments <br>to restrain their own hunger.</p>
<h3 id="s40-the-ones-who-remain-whole">40. The Ones Who Remain Whole</h3>
<p>Heaven remains Heaven because it does not exalt itself. <br>The earth remains earth because it does not resist its nature. <br>And the soul remains whole when it refuses to be divided.</p>
<h3 id="s41-the-return">41. The Return</h3>
<p>The movement of the Way is return— <br>not to the past, but to the unborn Light within you. <br>All things rise from the Source, <br>and the Source rises from silence.</p>
<h3 id="s42-the-three-seekers">42. The Three Seekers</h3>
<p>The wise hear the living word <br>and let it cut them to the heart; <br>they descend gladly into their own poverty. <br>The many hear it and weigh it like a coin, <br>spending a little, keeping a little. <br>The foolish hear it and laugh aloud, <br>mocking what they have not yet seen.</p>
<p>Yet I tell you: <br>the Light plays in them all. <br>The laughers, the traders, the broken ones--- <br>each walks toward the bridal chamber, <br>though some walk with their backs turned.</p>
<h3 id="s43-the-birth-of-the-two">43. The Birth of the Two</h3>
<p>The Source gives birth to the Father and the Mother. <br>The Two give birth to the Many. <br>The Many return to the One.</p>
<p>He who sees the One in every form and motion <br>cannot be shaken.</p>
<h3 id="s44-the-gentle-overcomes">44. The Gentle Overcomes</h3>
<p>Truly I say to you: <br>what is soft and willing <br>passes where hardness breaks. <br>Water, patient and lowly, <br>hollows the rock of ages.</p>
<p>So the soul that yields to the Living One <br>passes through every barrier <br>and cannot be imprisoned.</p>
<h3 id="s45-treasure-and-self">45. Treasure and Self</h3>
<p>Fame or life—which is more precious? <br>Gain or the soul—which is more valuable?</p>
<p>The one who knows their true nature <br>cannot be seduced away from it.</p>
<h3 id="s46-the-great-fulness">46. The Great Fulness</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Empty Vessel</h2>
<h3 id="s47-the-yoke-of-peace">47. The Yoke of Peace</h3>
<p>When the Way is lived, the ox knows its master's stall. <br>When the Way is forgotten, the sword is drawn in the street.</p>
<p>The yoke of the world is heavy with desire. <br>My yoke is easy, and brings peace.</p>
<h3 id="s48-seeing-without-seeking">48. Seeing Without Seeking</h3>
<p>You cross seas and deserts to seek signs, <br>yet the Sign looks out through your own eyes.</p>
<p>Without leaving your house, <br>you may behold the world within you. <br>Without straining your sight, <br>you may know the One who sees.</p>
<p>The more you chase what is outside, <br>the more you forsake the Treasure within.</p>
<h3 id="s49-the-unlearning">49. The Unlearning</h3>
<p>The scholar gathers more words each day <br>and builds a tower of opinions. <br>The seeker of the Way <br>lays one stone down each day <br>until only open sky remains.</p>
<p>She strips off garment after garment--- <br>belief, fear, reputation--- <br>until the naked Light stands forth.</p>
<p>He who lets go of all things <br>discovers that he holds the All.</p>
<h3 id="s50-the-heart-of-the-single-one">50. The Heart of the Single One</h3>
<p>The Single One is good to those who are good, <br>and good to those who are not good— <br>seeing only the Light within them.</p>
<p>Trusting those who trust, <br>and trusting those who do not trust— <br>for trust flows from the inner being, not theirs.</p>
<h3 id="s51-life-and-death">51. Life and Death</h3>
<p>Those who cling to life fear death. <br>Those who know Me fear neither.</p>
<p>Death is but the undressing of the bride <br>before she enters the chamber.</p>
<h3 id="s52-the-nourishing-way">52. The Nourishing Way</h3>
<p>The Way gives birth, nourishes, guides, protects, <br>and does so without claiming ownership.</p>
<p>Thus the Single One completes the work and forgets the work— <br>and it remains forever.</p>
<h3 id="s53-return-to-the-mother">53. Return to the Mother</h3>
<p>Know the Mother of your soul, <br>and you recognize all her children. <br>Know the children as passing forms, <br>and you are drawn back to the Mother.</p>
<p>In returning to the Womb of Light <br>you are no longer wounded by the powers, <br>for you remember that you were never separate <br>from the One who birthed you.</p>
<h3 id="s54-the-eye-of-the-needle">54. The Eye of the Needle</h3>
<p>The world says, "Strive to enter the narrow gate." <br>But I tell you: The gate is narrow only because you carry the burden of the many.</p>
<p>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle <br>than for the one rich in self to enter the Kingdom. <br>Become small, become single, <br>and the narrow path becomes wide as the sky.</p>
<h3 id="s55-the-unshakable-root">55. The Unshakable Root</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Unforced Life</h2>
<h3 id="s56-the-child-of-the-light">56. The Child of the Light</h3>
<p>One who lives in the Light is like a newborn child— <br>unafraid of serpents, unmoved by loud voices, unharmed by illusions. <br>The bones are soft, yet the strength is great.</p>
<h3 id="s57-the-one-who-knows">57. The One Who Knows</h3>
<p>The Spirit speaks only when the tongue is still. <br>The empty vessel echoes loudly; the full vessel is silent. <br>Yet I speak through silence <br>more clearly than all the world's voices.</p>
<p>Seal the senses. Quiet the mind. <br>Be still—and you behold the All.</p>
<h3 id="s58-non-interference">58. Non-Interference</h3>
<p>When rulers trust only decrees, <br>hearts grow clever in hiding. <br>When rulers trust only the sword, <br>fear multiplies in the streets.</p>
<p>Transform the world <br>by letting the Light transform you. <br>Cleanse the spring, <br>and the water flowing outward becomes sweet.</p>
<h3 id="s59-the-mystery-of-opposites">59. The Mystery of Opposites</h3>
<p>When rulers are gentle, people thrive. <br>When rulers are harsh, people grow cunning.</p>
<p>Misfortune hides in good fortune; <br>good fortune hides in misfortune. <br>The wise trust neither shadow, but cling only to the Real.</p>
<h3 id="s60-the-economy-of-spirit">60. The Economy of Spirit</h3>
<p>Restrain desire. Conserve energy. Return to the root. <br>Those who spend life strengthening the inner being <br>become inexhaustible.</p>
<h3 id="s61-governing-by-non-grasping">61. Governing by Non-Grasping</h3>
<p>Guide the soul as you would leaven the dough: <br>gently, until the whole loaf rises. <br>The Single One governs by not ruling, <br>teaches by not preaching, <br>achieves by not striving. <br>Thus the world settles in such presence.</p>
<h3 id="s62-the-great-acceptance">62. The Great Acceptance</h3>
<p>The Kingdom is like the Great Sea. <br>It refuses no river, <br>no matter how bitter or clouded. <br>It judges no stream, <br>but takes all into its depth, <br>making them one.</p>
<p>So too the Living One <br>receives the pure and the stained alike, <br>until all are cleared in the vastness of Love.</p>
<h3 id="s63-the-treasure-within">63. The Treasure Within</h3>
<p>The Living Way is shelter for all beings--- <br>a home for the whole and the broken alike.</p>
<p>Beautiful words can stir the mind, <br>but a heart that has found this hidden refuge <br>quietly transforms the world.</p>
<h3 id="s64-the-small-actions">64. The Small Actions</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Wisdom of the Child</h2>
<h3 id="s65-the-first-step">65. The First Step</h3>
<p>A great tree grows from a mustard seed <br>hidden in the dark earth. <br>A house is raised from a single stone. <br>The journey to the Father <br>begins exactly where your feet stand now.</p>
<p>Do not wait for a holier place or time. <br>The bridal chamber is built <br>from the step you take today.</p>
<h3 id="s66-innocence-as-wisdom">66. Innocence as Wisdom</h3>
<p>The ancient sages did not attempt to enlighten the people— <br>they helped them return to simplicity. <br>The more cleverness people acquire, <br>the further they drift from the Way.</p>
<h3 id="s67-leading-by-following">67. Leading by Following</h3>
<p>The river does not boast, <br>yet the valley drinks from it. <br>The one who makes himself high <br>passes like a cloud; <br>the one who makes himself low <br>waters many fields.</p>
<p>So the Single One leads by standing beneath all, <br>bearing the weight of the weary, <br>and because there is no competition in him, <br>there is nothing in him to oppose.</p>
<h3 id="s68-the-three-jewels">68. The Three Jewels</h3>
<p>I have three treasures in this world: <br>a heart that will not wound, <br>a life that delights in simplicity, <br>and a soul that refuses to stand above another.</p>
<p>Guard these, <br>and you will walk in the Light with me. <br>Lose them, <br>and you will trade the Kingdom for dust.</p>
<h3 id="s69-the-peaceful-warrior">69. The Peaceful Warrior</h3>
<p>The greatest warrior does not fight. <br>The greatest general does not stir anger. <br>The greatest victory leaves no wounds.</p>
<p>Master yourself, and the world is mastered.</p>
<h3 id="s70-the-paradox-of-yielding">70. The Paradox of Yielding</h3>
<p>There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your opponent— <br>your opponent being your own deluded self. <br>Yield, and the false self collapses.</p>
<h3 id="s71-a-teaching-few-understand">71. A Teaching Few Understand</h3>
<p>My words are simple to the ear <br>yet sharp to the heart. <br>Many copy the sayings, <br>but few let them unwind their old garments.</p>
<p>Blessed is the one <br>who wears the teaching as skin <br>and lets the former self fall away like husk. <br>Such a one walks unseen, <br>yet the world is fed by their presence.</p>
<h3 id="s72-the-gift-of-not-knowing">72. The Gift of Not-Knowing</h3>
<p>To know that you do not know—this is clarity. <br>To think you know while living in ignorance—this is blindness. <br>The awakened remove the cataract from their own sight first.</p>
<h3 id="s73-the-fear-of-the-false-self">73. The Fear of the False Self</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Return to Source</h2>
<h3 id="s74-the-courage-of-the-way">74. The Courage of the Way</h3>
<p>Daring without wisdom leads to death. <br>Wisdom without daring leads nowhere. <br>The Way gives courage that does not wound <br>and power that does not dominate.</p>
<h3 id="s75-the-one-who-judges">75. The One Who Judges</h3>
<p>Why fear death? <br>The Living Source alone dissolves forms. <br>Those who attempt to take the place of the eternal <br>are like a child pretending to steer a great chariot— <br>dangerous to self and others.</p>
<h3 id="s76-the-burden-of-excess">76. The Burden of Excess</h3>
<p>People suffer because they cling to excess. <br>The Single One lives lightly, needing little. <br>Carrying no burden, fearing no loss.</p>
<h3 id="s77-the-green-wood-and-the-dry">77. The Green Wood and the Dry</h3>
<p>When the wood is green, it is full of sap and bends. <br>When the wood is dry, it is brittle and snaps. <br>That which yields belongs to the Living One; <br>that which resists belongs to the grave. <br>The one who remains supple cannot be broken.</p>
<h3 id="s78-the-winnowing-fan">78. The Winnowing Fan</h3>
<p>The Father's way is like the winnowing fan: <br>separating the grain from the chaff, <br>gathering the worthy and scattering the empty.</p>
<p>As the Father separates without hatred, <br>so too the Single One gives to the needy without claiming virtue.</p>
<h3 id="s79-the-stone-and-the-corner">79. The Stone and the Corner</h3>
<p>The rain that softens the earth <br>outlasts the sword that scars it. <br>The tear upon the rock, returning again and again, <br>carves what the hammer cannot.</p>
<p>The stone the builders rejected <br>has become the cornerstone of the temple. <br>So too the gentle, despised by the strong, <br>uphold a world they did not claim as theirs.</p>
<h3 id="s80-the-end-of-debts">80. The End of Debts</h3>
<p>Even after a truce, resentment lingers. <br>But the awakened hold no accounts. <br>They see no debtor, no creditor— <br>only the One Light in many forms.</p>
<h3 id="s81-the-simple-kingdom">81. The Simple Kingdom</h3>
<p>Imagine a small, peaceful land <br>where people taste simplicity <br>and lose the appetite for excess. <br>Such a kingdom is within you. <br>Live there, and the world outside becomes gentle.</p>
<h3 id="s82-the-completion">82. The Completion</h3>
<p>Truth does not dress itself in splendor. <br>Splendor often hides a lie.</p>
<p>I give what I have been given <br>and do not count the cost. <br>The more the Single One pours out, <br>the more the Source flows through him--- <br>for he draws not from his own store, <br>but from the spring that cannot be emptied.</p>
<p>So the scripture ends where the Way begins: <br>in silence, in seeing, <br>in the Light that you are.</p>
